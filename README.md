[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anapsix/docker-alpine-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anapsix/docker-alpine-java)

Basic [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image to run [Java](https://www.java.com/) applications.
This image is based on [AlpineLinux](http://alpinelinux.org/) to keep the size down, yet smaller images do exist.
Includes BASH, since many Java applications like to have convoluted BASH start-up scripts.

### DEPRECATION DUE TO ORACLE JAVA LICENSING CHANGE

> Thank you to everyone using images derived from this repo, to everyone who inspired and contributed.
> After April 2019, due to Oracle Java licensing changes, this repo is deprecated, and is now for reference only.
> No new builds will be published to `anapsix/alpine-java` repo on Docker Hub from this Github repo.

As announced, Java licensing changed, and starting April 2019 commercial usage of Oracle Java required subscription.
In other words, switch to OpenJDK, or use older versions of Oracle Java (for reference, pre-built images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/anapsix/alpine-java/))

Official OpenJDK images receive regular updates, and are available at https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk, including `8-jre-alpine` (85MB), `8-jdk-alpine` (105MB), `8-jre-slim` (204MB), `8-jdk-slim` (243MB), `8u212-jre-slim` (204MB), `8u212-jdk-slim` (243MB), etc..

TL;DR
> Oracle JDK 8 is going through the “End of Public Updates” process, which means the April 2019 update will restrict commercial use. However, since Java SE 9, Oracle is also providing Oracle OpenJDK builds which are free for commercial use (but only updated for 6 months). There are also free OpenJDK builds which will be updated (including security patches) from other providers like AdoptOpenJDK, Amazon, Azul, BellSoft, IBM, jClarity, Red Hat, the Linux distros et al.

And many others talking about Oracle Java SE licensing changes ([Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=java+oracle+license))

### Versions/tags

| software     | version      |
|--------------|--------------|
| alpine       | `3.8`        |
| glibc        | `2.29-r0`    |
| java 8       | `8u202b08`   |

#### MAJOR TAGGING UPDATE
To allow selection of specific Java version, a **major retagging is taking place**.
Old tags will remain for compatibility sake, but are no longer documented.
`:8`,`:7` and `:latest` are all valid, but are not "locked" to any specific Java version / patch set - i.e. depending on when you pull the `:8` tagged image, for example, you might end up with `8u102b14`, `8u112b15`, `8u121b13`, etc..
Well, `:7` no as much, since it's EOL and no more patches are released.

However specific `:8uXXXbYY` tags (such as `:8u102b14`, `:8u112b15`) will guarantee particular MAJOR-MINOR-BUILD Java versions.

#### JCE Policy
Special `_unlimited` images are available with Unlimited JCE Policy

**Early Release MUSL JRE9 / JDK9**: `9 / 9_jdk`
**Latest JRE8/JDK8 Version**: `8u202b08`
**Latest JRE7/JDK7 Version**: `7u80b15` - no longer buildable, as Oracle provides no downloadable packages.
**JDK8/JDK7 Versions with alternative JVM - [DCEVM](https://dcevm.github.io/)**: `light-8u112` / `full-7u80`
